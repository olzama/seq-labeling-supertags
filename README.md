These two scripts are used to:
1) Pull out data from a CONNLU file. This data can then be tagged with HPSG supertags using https://github.com/olzama/neural-supertagging
2) Given the supertags (a textfile, tags separated by commas, one sentence per line), replace the original UD tags with the HPSG tags.
